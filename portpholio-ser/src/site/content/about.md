# About

This is an experiment where I'm trying to build a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) site with:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)
* [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)

The source code is available at: [https://github.com/hlaueriksson/jamstack-cms](https://github.com/hlaueriksson/jamstack-cms)

The site is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) at: [http://jamstack-cms.netlify.com](http://jamstack-cms.netlify.com)

The jam recipes was taken from the Swedish site [Tasteline.com](http://www.tasteline.com):

* [Apple Jam](http://www.tasteline.com/recept/appelmos-grundrecept/)
* [Lingonberry Jam](http://www.tasteline.com/recept/lingonsylt/)
* [Strawberry Jam](http://www.tasteline.com/recept/jordgubbssylt/)

Translations from Swedish to English was done with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/#sv/en/).
